# BrauerInduction

Lean 4 formalization of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer%27s_theorem_on_induced_characters">Brauer's
induction theorem on induced characters</a> following Bernstein's 2007 proof.

The main result is in file `BrauerInduction.Main`: 

```Lean
BrauerInduction.character_eq_sum_induced_linear
    {G : Type u} [Group G] [Finite G]
    {k : Type u} [Field k] [CharZero k] [IsAlgClosed k]
    (V : FDRep k G) :
    ∃ (ι : Type) (_ : Fintype ι)
      (ns : ι → ℤ) (Hs : ι → Subgroup G)
      (ψs : ∀ i, Hs i →* kˣ),
      (∀ i, IsBrauerElementary (Hs i)) ∧
      V.character =
        ∑ i, ns i • (FDRep.indLin (Hs i) (ψs i)).character
```

## Building 

```bash
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

## Comparator check

This repository includes a `leanprover/comparator` harness.

* `Challenge.lean` gives a concise Mathlib-based statement of Brauer induction.
* `Solution.lean` proves that statement from the main theorem in this project.
* `comparator.json` permits only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.

 ## Note

This is a personal formalization project. It is made public in the hope that
parts of it may be useful or interesting to other Lean users.
